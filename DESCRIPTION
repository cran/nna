Description: Calculates spatial pattern analysis using a T-square sample procedure.
  This method is based on two measures "x" and "y".
  "x" - Distance from the random point to the nearest individual.
  "y" - Distance from individual to its nearest neighbor.
  This is a methodology commonly used in phytosociology or marine benthos ecology to analyze the species' distribution (random, uniform or clumped patterns).
